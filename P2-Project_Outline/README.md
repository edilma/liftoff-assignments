# Project Outline
How many of you own a car? According to the department of motor vehicles, there are about 290 million registered cars in the United States alone. 
What we would like to do is ensure that every person is able to store their vehicle information such as maintenance services and performance changes!
Users will have the ability to add multiple cars to their profiles and track events such as:
Maintenance service details
Performance modifications details
Dates when the maintenance and/or performance were done
Cost of the maintenance and/or performance
Create reports of the maintenance done and/or performance changes added. 

### Features
User Login: Users will be able to “log in” to the system and create their own profiles. They will be able to reset their passwords and create a new user without administrators involved.

##  Cars: 
Users will be able to add, Delete and transfer cars.

## Maintenance: 
Users will be able to input the maintenance that has been completed to the vehicle.  The system also will be able to tell them if it should happen again and when .

## Performance: 
Users will be able to input the upgrades to their vehicles and list what upgrades have been made so far and when. They will be able to also add the price they paid for each part and see how it brings more value to their car

## Car Lookup: 
We will be using an API for users to just plug in the vehicle VIN and it will auto populate the car information ( make, year,  model, etc).

### Technologies
C# / .Net Core
.Net MVC
LINQ
Entity Framework
Mysql

Bootstrap
GIT
Visual Studio 2019

### What We Will Have to Learn
We will have to learn to make our front end aesthetically pleasing and incorporate a lot of Bootstrap and Javascript. Will also have to learn how to use an API to populate or vehicle information. Will need to learn how to use JSON that gets passed through our API call.
